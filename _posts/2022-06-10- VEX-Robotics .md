My reflection on Vex Vr:
I find it useful and fun and a different experience. However, the system of infrastructure should be developed because it has limitations. There should be more maps and more different robots. For example, there should be a robot having an arm. Thinking about the educational area, I find this platform very useful. People can learn algorithms and code and understand the logic of robots and how to make robots. They can start to understand the logic of code. 


My VEX Robotics STEM Labs task's explanation is here
Drawing Squares
Playground: Grid Map
Category: VEX V5 for High school students
Level: Beginner
Subject: Arts and Math
Challenge: 
Level 1:
Program the VR Robot to make its velocity and rotation speed %100. Program the VR Robot to turn right for 90 degrees. Next, program the VR Robot to draw the path. Next, program the VR robot to drive forward according to the number of the grid squares that are chosen. 

Level 2:
Program the VR Robot to turn left for 90 degrees and drive forward according to the number of the grid squares that are chosen when it arrived in the distance. Program the VR Robot to do it 4 times this. Program the VR Robot to stop when it arrived at its beginning position. In other words, when it completes a square, program it to stop.

Helpful Hints:
Each square in the Grid Map measures 200mm by 200mm. 

Try using the Repeat block.
